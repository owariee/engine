# ðŸ§Š Engine

This is an engine in development, by now we have an opengl graphics backend.
Feel free to contribute!!

## Cloning the repo

`git clone git@github.com:owariee/engine.git`

### Updating submodules

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Building

### Ubuntu dependencies when building libraries from source (default behaviour)

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev python
```

### Building

Inside the repository after clone(see `Cloning the repo`), execute these commands:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can also create a file called build.sh and paste the content described, then
give the right permissions with `chmod +x build.sh` and execute `./build.sh`.

### Cross-platform development build with Docker

1. Build the image

`docker build -t engine:dev0 .`

2. Run the container (this will compile the project)

`docker run -t -v $(pwd):/engine engine:dev0`
